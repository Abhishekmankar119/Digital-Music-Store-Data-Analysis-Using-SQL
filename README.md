Using SQL, I performed an in-depth analysis of digital music store's data, focusing on customer behavior and revenue generation. By querying the database and applying various analytical techniques, I was able to extract meaningful insights that can guide decision-making and improve company's overall business performance.

This information can be utilized to develop personalized marketing strategies, loyalty programs, and special offers to further engage and retain these valuable customers.
Revenue by Country: By aggregating sales data and analyzing customer locations, I determined the top revenue-generating countries for our digital music store. This insight enables us to focus our marketing efforts, localization strategies, and customer support resources on these regions to maximize revenue potential.
